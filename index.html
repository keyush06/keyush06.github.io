	I am an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University. I spent a lovely last year learning from Prof. <a href="https://www.zacharylipton.com">Zachary Lipton</a> as a Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I was an undergrad at IIT Delhi where I was fortunate to work with Profs. <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/">Mausam</a>, <a href="https://https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/">Parag Singla</a>, <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/">Sayan Ranu</a>, and <a href="https://subodhvsharma.github.io">Subodh Sharma</a>.

	<!-- <p> -->
	<!-- My broad research aspirations are towards developing deep learning into a mature science and engineering discipline. --> 

	<!-- <ol> -->

	<!-- <li> -->
	<!-- 	An empirical theory of deep learning which can serve as a guide to practitioners, help us understand the successes and limitations of current approaches, and motivate new ones. -->
	<!-- </li> -->
	<!-- <li> -->
	<!-- 	Extending the capabilities by expanding the research frontier to include more tasks, such as reasoning. -->
	<!-- </li> -->

	<!-- </ol> -->

	<!-- My first foray into research was at the intersection of Distributed Systems, Programming Languages, and Formal Methods, borrowing aspects of classical AI such as constraint satisfaction. I still maintain a passing interest in these domains and would love to chat about anything related! -->
	<!-- </p> -->

	<!-- <p> -->
	<!-- Outside of research, I want to develop a strong mental model of the world we live in, leading to passing interests in the basic sciences, history, economics, philosophy and the likes. I like to read and listen to long form content (books, audiobooks, podcasts). I also love physical activities. -->

	<!-- Always up for talking about research, life, or anything else. Feel free to reach out! -->
